Description: Implementations for simulating from and fitting two different Bayesian models of differential co-expression. scDECO.cop fits the bivariate Gaussian copula model from Zichen Ma, Shannon W. Davis, Yen-Yi Ho (2023) <doi:10.1111/biom.13701>, while scDECO.pg fits the bivariate Poisson-Gamma model from Zhen Yang, Yen-Yi Ho (2022) <doi:10.1111/biom.13457>.
