Description: scDECO is an R package for estimating differential co-expression in single-cell RNA-seq data. Differential co-expression refers to correlation between two random variables changing with respect to the value of some covariate(s). This package contains implementations for two different Bayesian models. scDECO.cop fits a bivariate Gaussian copula model with flexible, covariate-dependent, optionally zero-inflated marginals. scDECO.pg fits a zero-inflated bivariate Poisson-Gamma model with correlation imparted through a latent bivariate normal variable.
