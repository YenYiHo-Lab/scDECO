Description: Implementations for simulating from and fitting two different Bayesian models of differential co-expression. scDECO.cop fits the bivariate Gaussian copula model from Ma, Zichen, Shannon W. Davis, and Yen‚ÄêYi Ho (2021) <https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article/79/2/1559/75139761>, while scDECO.pg fits the bivariate Poisson-Gamma model from Yang, Zhen, and Yen-Yi Ho (2022) <https://academic.oup.com/biometrics/article/78/2/766/74600627>.
